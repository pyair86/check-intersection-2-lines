Check whether 2 lines are intersected

Given 2 lines, there are 4 points to anlyze:

line1Point1, line1Point2

line2Point1, line2Point2

if:

(line1Point1, line1Point2, line2Point2) and (line1Point1, line1Point2, line2Point1) and

(line2Point1, line2Point2, line1Point1) and (line2Point1, line2Point2, line1Point2) 

present different orientations

if:

the points above are all collinear and the X,Y of the lines are intersecting. 

A corresponding plot is preesnted to visually assert test output.
